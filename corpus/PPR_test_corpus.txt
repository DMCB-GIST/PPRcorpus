11602283_1	Hamamelitannin from Hamamelis virginiana inhibits the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-induced endothelial cell death in vitro.
11602283	20	40	Hamamelis virginiana	Plant

11602283_2	The tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitory activity of hamamelitannin from Hamamelis virginiana was investigated by assessing the TNF-mediated EAhy926 endothelial cell death and adhesiveness to monocytes.
11602283	82	102	Hamamelis virginiana	Plant

11602283_3	Treatment of the cells by TNF (25 ng/ml) and actinomycin D (0.1ng/ml) resulted in significant DNA fragmentation (34+/-0.6, n=4) and cytotoxicity (97+/-4.5%, n=6) following treatment for 8 and 24h, respectively.

11602283_4	One to 100 microM concentrations of hamamelitannin inhibited the TNF-mediated endothelial cell death and DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner.

11602283_5	One hundred % protection against TNF-induced DNA fragmentation and cytotoxicity was obtained for hamamelitannin concentrations higher than 10 microM.
11602283	67	79	cytotoxicity	Negative_phenotype

11602283_6	The protective effect of hamamelitannin was comparable with that of a related compound epigallocatechin gallate while gallic acid was a weak protective agent (<40% protection).

11602283_7	EAhy926 endothelial cells upregulated (by 4- to 7-fold) the surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and adhesiveness to monocytic U937 cells after treatment with TNF (0.5ng/ml) for 6 or 24h.

11602283_8	Concentrations (1-100 microM) of hamamelitannin that inhibited the TNF-mediated cell death and DNA fragmentation, however, failed to inhibit the TNF-induced ICAM-1 expression and EAhy926 cell adhesiveness to U937 cells.
11602283	208	212	U937	Negative_phenotype

11602283_9	Thus, hamamelitannin inhibits the TNF-mediated endothelial cell death without altering the TNF-induced upregulation of endothelial adhesiveness.

15222974_5	In vitro treatment with Vimang at 40 microg/ml also inhibited mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but did not affect mRNA levels of IL-6 or tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).

15222974_6	Extracellular release of TNF-alpha by inflammatory macrophages was inhibited by in vitro treatment with Vimang at the same concentrations that showed inhibition of TNF-alpha mRNA levels.
15222974	104	110	Vimang	Plant

15222974_7	The inhibition of TNF-alpha production appears to be at least partially attributable to MA.

15222974_8	Vimang at 4 microg/ml decreased mRNA levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but did not affect expression of the NF-kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB).
15222974	0	6	Vimang	Plant

15222974_9	These data indicate that the potent anti-inflammatory effects of Vimang are due to selective modulation of the expression of inflammation-related genes, leading to attenuation of macrophage activation.

16039554_3	To understand its mechanism of pharmacological action, its effects on endothelial monolayer permeability are studied.

16039554_4	The present study demonstrated that extract of S. miltiorrhiza (ESM) and its major ingredients, Danshensu (DSS) and salvianolic acid B (Sal B), inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) induced endothelial permeability, whereas the other major ingredient, protocatechualdehyde, was ineffective.

16039554_5	ESM, DSS and Sal B also repressed expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in TNF-alpha induced HUVEC cells.

16039554_6	Furthermore, it was found that ESM attenuated the disorganization of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin induced by TNF-alpha.
16039554	31	34	ESM	Plant

16039554_7	The effect of ESM on TNF-alpha induced endothelial permeability and redistribution of VE-cadherin is likely due to a reduction of VEGF protein expression as a result of modulation of the ERK signaling pathway.

16141313_4	We examined four biflavonoids isolated from S. chamaejasme L., including isochamaejasmin, two of its stereo-isomers and a methyl derivative, in functional assays originally designed to screen ligands for the G protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1).
16141313	44	61	S. chamaejasme L.	Plant

16141313_5	Isochamaejasmin was found to induce the expression of a nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-directed reporter gene in transfected HeLa cells with an EC50 of 3.23 microM, independently of FPRL1.
16141313	121	125	HeLa	Negative_phenotype

16141313_6	The isochamaejasmin-stimulated NF-kappaB reporter activity was accompanied by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB proteins and was blocked by a dominant-negative construct of IkappaBalpha.

16141313_7	Isochamaejasmin also induced time-dependent phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38, and a novel protein kinase C (PKCdelta).

16141313_8	Likewise, inhibition of these kinases with the respective pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced the isochamaejasmin-stimulated NF-kappaB activation.

16141313_9	It is noteworthy that the two stereoisomers and the methyl derivative did not induce detectable activation of NF-kappaB and were more cytotoxic than isochamaejasmin, which could partially rescue cycloheximide-induced apoptosis.

16141313_10	Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of isochamaejasmin.

16141313_11	These results provide the first evidence for a potential mechanism of action by S. chamaejasme L., and indicate that structurally similar compounds derived from S. chamaejasme L. may have different pharmacological properties.

16631160_3	Platycodin D is the major constituent of triterpene saponins in the root.

16631160_4	This study investigates apoptosis by platycodin D in immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT).

16631160_5	Platycodin D-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and caspase-8 activation.

16631160_6	Platycodin D could activate inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB kinase (IKK)-beta in the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation of upstream level, but not IKK-alpha.

16631160_7	Pretreated-N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, could suppress the induction of apoptosis and activation of NF-kappaB of HaCaT cells by platycodin D. We also demonstrated that platycodin D-mediated apoptosis of HaCaT cells upregulates Fas receptor and Fas ligand (FasL) expression, but did not exhibit p53 activation.

16631160_8	HaCaT cells were also transfected with pFLF1, which preserves the promoter region of Fas receptor gene containing NF-kappaB binding site.

16631160_9	On incubation with platycodin D, the NF-kappaB activity related to Fas receptor increased in a dose-dependent manner.

16631160_10	Among the major transcription elements on Fas receptor and FasL promoter, NF-kappaB activation was shown to have an essential role in the expression of the death receptor such as FasL.

16631160_11	These results suggest that platycodin D has the ability to induce apoptosis in HaCaT cells through the upregulation of Fas receptor and FasL expression via to NF-kappaB activation in the transcriptional level.

16631160_12	These results demonstrate that the NF-kappaB activation plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis in human HaCaT cells on treatment with platycodin D.

21652192_6	The extracts prohibited the cytotoxic effect of CP and recovered the mitotic activity, whereas E1 possessed the highest recovery and mitosis.

21652192_7	In absence of MN, CP induced formation of bi- and poly-nucleated BMCs.

21652192_8	E1 prohibited CP-induced formation of bi-nucleated BMCs, while E2 and E3 prohibited CP-induced formation of poly-nucleated BMCs.

21652192_9	CP-induced MN-BMCs were accompanied with mono-, bi- and poly-nucleated cells.

21652192_10	E1 and E3 remarkably suppressed mono-nucleated MN-BMCs, while E2 inhibited bi-nucleated MN-BMCs.

21652192_11	All the extracts significantly inhibited the CP-induced formation of poly-nucleated MN-BMCs.

21652192_12	CP-induced DNA fragmentation was inhibited by all extracts, where E1 was the strongest inhibitor as concluded from the comet tail moment.

21652192_13	All the extracts were strong OH scavengers, while only E3 was ROO scavenger.

21652192_14	The results revealed a drastic decline in HDACs activity by E1 and E3.

21652192_15	In conclusion, S. dentifolium polysaccharide extracts E1 and E3 possessed a potential anti-genotoxic and a promising anti-mutagenic activity.

25861954_7	The superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assayed by SOD and MPO kits, respectively.

25861954_8	The levels of inflammation mediators including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-1b, and IL-6 were assayed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.

25861954_9	Pathological changes of lung tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining.

25861954_10	The levels of P-PI3K, PI3K, P-Akt, Akt, P-mTOR and mTOR were measured by Western blotting.

25861954_11	RESULTS: The data showed that treatment with the WETMHM inhibited LPS-induced inflammation: (1) WETMHM attenuated inflammation cell numbers in the BALF, (2) decreased protein levels of lung PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and (3) improved SOD activity and (4) inhibited MPO activity; (5) histological studies demonstrated that WETMHM substantially inhibited LPS-induced neutrophils in lung tissue.

26916550_13	The administration of kinsenoside significantly suppressed levels of TNF-a, IFN-y, and IL-17, but increased concentrations of IL-10 in the supernatants of each of the splenocytes in CIA mice compared with that in the H2O-treated mice with CIA.

26916550_14	Using flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrated that kinsenoside increases the population of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the Th1 cell and B cell populations.

26916550_15	Anticollagen IgG1 and IgG2a levels decreased in the serum of kinsenoside-treated mice.

26916550_16	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the administration of kinsenoside effectively suppressed inflammatory mediators' production and bone erosion in mice with collagen-induced arthritis showing the potential as an anti-arthritis agent.

27571702	Decrease	15	19	AAFE	Plant	28	45	AD  -like lesions	Negative_phenotype

27571702_9	With regards to its mechanism of action, AAFE inhibited the phosphorylation of Lck/yes  -related novel tyrosine kinase (Lyn), spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), mitogen  -activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositide 3  -kinase (PI3K)/Akt and IkBa, which have essential roles in the production of various cytokines in lymph nodes.
27571702	41	45	AAFE	Plant

27571702_10	The suppressive activity of AAFE may be due to the inhibition of a series of immunopathological events, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines.
27571702	28	32	AAFE	Plant

27571702_11	The results of the present study strongly suggest that AAFE exerts an anti  -AD effect by inhibiting the Lyn, Syk, MAPKs, PI3K/Akt and IkBa pathways.
